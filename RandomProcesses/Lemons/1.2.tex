\levelstay{Independent Failure Modes}

\leveldown{Problem}

A system consists of $n$ spearate components, each one of which fails independently of the others with probability $P_i$, where $i=1 \ldots n$.
Since each component mus either fail or not fail, the probability that the $i$th component does not fail is $1 - P_i$.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[a.] Suppose the components are connected in parallel so that the failure of all components is necessary to cause the system to fail.
What is the probability that the system fails?
What is the probability that the system functions?

  \item[b.] Suppose the components are connected in series so that the failure of any one component causes the system to fail.
What is the probability that the system fails?
\end{itemize}

\levelstay{Solution}

In the parallel case, the probability that the system fails is the product of the indpependent probabilities of each component to fail, i.e. $\prod_i P_i$.
The probability that the system functions is therefore $1 - \prod_i P_i$.

In the series case, the probability that the system fails is 1 minus the probability that no component fails, i.e. $1 - \prod_i (1 - P_i)$.
