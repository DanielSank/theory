\leveldown{Problem}

Use energy equipartition to show that, in a circuit composed of an inductance $L$ shorted through a resistance $R$ at equilibrium temperature $T$, equilibrium current fluctuations hav ea mean $\avg{I(\infty)}=0$ and variance $\avg{I(\infty)^2} = kT/L$.

\levelstay{Solution}

The energy required to put current $I$ into an inductor is $E = LI^2/2$.
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
  \avg{E} =& (L/2) \avg{I^2} \\
  kT/2 =& (L/2) \avg{I^2} \\
  \to \avg{I^2} =& kT/L \, .
\end{align*}
