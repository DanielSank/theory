\levelstay{Frequency of Heads}

\leveldown{Problem}

Suppose the number of heads $N$ in $n$ coin flips is given by
\begin{equation*}
  N = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \, ,
\end{equation*}
where $X_i$ means that the $i$th flip has turned up heads and $X_i=0$ that it has turned up tails.
Assume these two outcomes are equally probable.
\begin{itemize}
  \item[a.] Find $\avg{X_i}$ and $\text{var}(X_i)$.
  \item[b.] Find $\avg{N}$ and $\text{var}(N)$.
  \item[c.] Find $\avg{N/n}$ and $\text{var}(N/n)$.
  \item[d.] Is the answer to part c consistent with the behavior of the frequency of heads $f(1)=N/n$ in figure 1.1 (on page 3)?
\end{itemize}

\leveldown{Solution}

Obviously, $\avg{X_i} = 1/2$ and $\avg{X_i^2} = 1/2$.
Therefore
\begin{align*}
  a. \qquad \qquad
  \avg{X_i} &= 1/4 \\
  \text{var}(X_i) &= 1/4 \\
  b. \qquad \qquad
  \avg{N} &= n \avg{X_i} = n/2 \\
  \text{var}(N) &= n \, \text{var}(X_i) = n / 4 \, .
\end{align*}
Define $S \equiv N/n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i/n$.
Clearly, $\avg{S} = \avg{N}/n = 1/2$.
Also
\begin{align*}
  c. \qquad \qquad
  \text{var}(S)
  &= \sum_{i=1}^n \text{var}(X_i/n) \\
  &= n \, \text{var}(X_i) / n^2 \\
  &= 1/4n \, .
\end{align*}
