    * Olav Kallenberg, Foundations of Modern Probability [Builds up the theory of stochastic integrals and stochastic differential equations from scratch, ending with a very general framework which makes it clear just which parts of the original approach, tied to the Wiener process, were necessary and which were accidental. However, Kallenberg's book is intended as a comprehensive textbook on probability theory, from measure theory through large deviations. This means that it is both mathematically demanding, and that he takes a "spiral" approach, revisitng this topic, like many others, repeatedly through the text. There are, however, abundant cross-references.]

No others hypothesis are assumed over the noise, neither the fluctuation dissipation theorem. We found that the characteristic functional of the linear process can be expressed in terms of noise's functional and the Green function of the deterministic (memory-like) dissipative dynamics. This object allow us to get a procedure to calculate all the Kolmogorov hierarchy of the non-Markov process. As examples we have characterized through the 1-time probability a noise-induced interplay between the dissipative dynamics and the structure of different noises. Conditions that lead to non-Gaussian statistics and distributions with long tails are analyzed. The introduction of arbitrary fluctuations in fractional Langevin equations have also been pointed out."]

In some cases, for example when studying the long term behaviour of the solar system or for complex systems, there exist elements which can influence the dynamics of the system which are not well modelled or even known. One way to take these problems into account consists of looking at the dynamics of the system on a larger class of objects, that are eventually stochastic. In this paper, we develop a theory for the stochastic embedding of ordinary differential equations. We apply this method to Lagrangian systems. In this particular case, we extend many results of classical mechanics namely, the least action principle, the Euler-Lagrange equations, and Noether's theorem. We also obtain a Hamiltonian formulation for our stochastic Lagrangian systems. Many applications are discussed at the end of the paper."]
