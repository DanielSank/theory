\leveldown{Solutions for the driven oscillator}

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item Find the Green function for the driven oscillator described by Eq.~(\ref{rf.eq:equation_of_motion_phasor}).
  \item Solve for $\alpha(t)$ in the case that $J(t) = J_0 \delta(t)$. In this case, it's convenient to choose $\omega_f = \omega_0'$.
  \item Write down $\phi(t)$ for your solution to the previous part.
  \item Solve for $\alpha(t)$ in the case that $J(t) = J_0 \cos(\Omega t)\Theta(t)$ ($\Theta$ is the step function). Try both $\omega_f = \Omega$ and $\omega_f = \omega_0$.
  \item Write down $\phi(t)$ for your solution to the previous part.
\end{enumerate}
