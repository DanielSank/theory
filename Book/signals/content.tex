\levelstay{Signals and Noise}

A basic working knowledge of signal analysis enables design of sophisticated experiments and accurate interpretation of data coming both from experiments and simulations.
In this chapter, we introduce the basics of signal analysis with a focus on Fourier methods.
We illustrate each concept with a realistic example comparing analytic calculation and numerics.
