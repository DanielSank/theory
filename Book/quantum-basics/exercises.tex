\leveldown{Driven two level system}

Consider a two level system with Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
  H_S(t) / \hbar = \underbrace{-\frac{1}{2} \omega_0 \sigma_z}_{H_0} + \underbrace{\Omega \cos(\omega_d t) \sigma_x}_{V_S(t)}
  \, .
\end{equation}
Use the interaction picture to find the time evolution of the expectation values of the pauli operators.

\levelstay{Transition rate - Fermi's golden rule}

Suppose we have a system in initial state $\ket{i}$ subject to a drive
\begin{equation} V(t)/\hbar = \Omega \cos(\omega_d t) A \end{equation}
where $\Omega$ has dimensions of frequency and $A$ is a dimensionless operator.
Suppose further that there is a continuum of final states $\ket{f}$ with energies close to $E_i + \omega_d$, and that the density of such states is $\rho$.
Assume that $\bbraket{f}{A}{i}$ is approximately constant for all $\ket{f}$.
Using first order time dependent perturbation theory, find the \emph{rate} of decrease of the probability for the system to remain in state $\ket{i}$.
You have proven Fermi's golden rule.
