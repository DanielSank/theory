\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prove that a system with an infinite number of frequencies has an infinitely long recurrence time. ``Proof by simulation'' is totally acceptable. For example, create an ensemble of frequencies $\{\omega_1, \omega_2,\ldots,\omega_N\}$ and plot the sum $(1/N) \sum_{n=1}^N \cos(\omega_n t)$ for a few values of $N$. Try $N=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 1000\}$.
\end{enumerate}
