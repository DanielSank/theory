In this note we show how to compute the probability distribution of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a white noise signal.
For an $N$ point sequence of white noise with Gaussian distribution of width $\sigma$, the real and imaginary parts of the discrete Fourier transform are both Gaussian distributed random variables with widths $\sigma\sqrt{N/2}$.
If the DFT is normalized by the number of points $N$, the width becomes $\sigma / \sqrt{2N}$.
