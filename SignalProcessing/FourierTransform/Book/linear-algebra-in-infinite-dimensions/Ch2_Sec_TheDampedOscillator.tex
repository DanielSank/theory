\section{The Damped, Driven Oscillator}
An enormous quantity of physical problems involve a differential equation called the damped, driven oscillator equation.  In basic mechanical terms it is the equation of motion for a mass on a spring which is subject to a velocity dependent frictional force, such as the viscous friction caused by a fluid, and a time dependent external force such as that exerted by a person pushing on the block.  See figure 1.  Let $\psi(t)$ denote the position of the oscillator at time $t$, $k$ be the spring constant of the spring, $m$ be the mass of the block, and $\gamma$ be the friction coefficient of the damping force.  If the frictional force is proportional to the velocity of the mass then it is given by $F_{friction}(t) = -\gamma \dot{\psi}(t)$ where $\gamma$ is the friction coefficient.  Denote the externally applied force by $F_a(t)$.  Then Newton's equation for this system is
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_a(t) + F_{friction}(t) + F_{spring}(t) &=& m \ddot{\psi}(t)\\
F_a(t) - \gamma \dot{\psi}(t) - k\psi (t) &=& m \ddot{\psi}(t)\\
\ddot{\psi}(t) + \frac{\gamma}{m}\dot{\psi}(t) + \frac{k}{m}\psi (t) &=& \frac{1}{m}F_a(t)
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:NewtonDampedOscillator}
\ddot{\psi}(t) + 2\beta\dot{\psi}(t) + \omega ^2_0 \psi(t) = J(t)
\end{equation}
where in the last equation we've defined $\omega^2_0 = \frac{k}{m}$, $\beta = \frac{\gamma}{2m}$, and $J(t) = \frac{1}{m}F_a(t)$.  In general we want to know how the mass moves for a given applied force, or in math language ``given some $F_a(t)$ what is $\psi(t)$?''  To answer this we have to solve the differential equation (\ref{eq:NewtonDampedOscillator}).  It is not at all obvious how to go about doing this, but by the end of this chapter you will know how to solve not only this equation, but an entire class of differential equations called, unsurprisingly, linear differential equations.
