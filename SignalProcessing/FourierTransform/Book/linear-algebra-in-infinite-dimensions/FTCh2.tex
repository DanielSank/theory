\chapter{Linear Algebra in Infinite Dimensions}
In this chapter we will use all of our tools developed in chapter 1 to analyse an infinite dimensional vector space, namely, the vector space of all functions of one real variable. We will then discuss an inner product for this space.  We will use the inner product to develop a basis and to investigate the question of changing basis. In the first chapter we were motivated to find a new basis because we wanted to diagonalize a certain linear transformation, in that case the transformation that defined our coupled mass problem. In this chapter we'll focus on the derivative, which is a linear transformation, and look at the basis that diagonalizes it. Of course we will apply our new tools to a physical problem, this time the damped, driven oscillator.  Sections dealing with this example will again be marked by a $\clubsuit$.
