Consider a noise process $X$.
The mean power over a time interval $\{-T/2,T/2\}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
P = \frac{1}{T} \avg{\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} \abs{x(t)}^2 \, dt}
\end{equation}
where the average is taken over realizations $x(t)$ of the noise.
A given realization can be written as a Fourier transform,
\begin{equation}
x(t) \equiv
\int \tilde{x}(\omega) e^{i \omega t} \, \frac{d \omega}{2\pi} \, .
\end{equation}
Let's use this to rewrite the mean power:
\begin{align}
P
&= \frac{1}{T}\avg{
\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} dt
\int \frac{d\omega}{2\pi}
\int \frac{d\omega'}{2\pi}
\tilde{x}(\omega) \tilde{x}(\omega')^*
e^{i(\omega - \omega')t}} \nonumber \\
&= \int \int \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} \frac{d\omega'}{2\pi}
\avg{\tilde{x}(\omega)\tilde{x}(\omega')^*}
\frac{\sin(T(\omega - \omega')/2)}{T (\omega - \omega')/2} \, .
\end{align}
Suppose we filter the signal so that only frequencies near $\pm \Omega$ remain, which we represent by restricting the frequency integrals to a range, say, of $\{\Omega-\Delta \omega, \Omega+\Delta \omega\}$ and $\{-\Omega - \Delta \omega, -\Omega + \delta \omega\}$.
This gives four little squares in the $\omega/\omega'$ plane over which we ned to do the integral.
However the $\sin(x)/x$ function is strongly peaked at $x=0$, so we actually only need to integrate over the patches where $\omega$ and $\omega'$ are both positive or both negative.
Focusing on the positive case and defining $\omega = \Omega + p$ and $\omega' = \Omega + q$, we have
\begin{align}
P_+ &=
\int_{-\Delta \omega/2}^{\Delta\omega/2}
\int_{-\Delta \omega/2}^{\Delta\omega/2}
\frac{dp}{2\pi} \frac{dq}{2\pi}
\avg{\tilde{x}(\Omega+p)\tilde{x}(\Omega+q)^*} \frac{\sin(T(p-q)/2)}{T(p-q)/2} \nonumber \\
(\text{assume }\Delta \omega \ll T) \quad &=
\frac{1}{T} \int_{-\Delta \omega/2}^{\Delta \omega / 2}
\frac{dp}{2\pi} \avg{\tilde{x}(\Omega + p) \tilde{x}(\Omega + p)^*} \nonumber \\
&= \frac{\avg{\abs{\tilde{x}(\Omega)}^2}}{T} \frac{\Delta \omega}{2 \pi}
\end{align}
where in the last line we assumed that $\tilde{x}$ is relatively constant over frequency width $\Delta \omega$.
If we were to repeat the computation for the $-\Omega$ region we'd get the same answer, so in the end the power is
\begin{equation}
P = 2 \frac{\avg{\abs{\tilde{x}(\Omega)}^2}}{T} \frac{\Delta \omega}{2\pi} \, .
\end{equation}
Therefore, we can \emph{estimate} the power in a certain frequency band as twice the mod square of the Fourier transform of the acquired signal, divided by the acquisition time.
The factor of two comes in because we're used a double sided Fourier transform.

If we define a spectral density $S$ as the power per bandwidth of the signal, then we've shown here that
\begin{equation}
2 \frac{\abs{\tilde{x}(\Omega)}^2}{T} \text{ is an estimator for } S(\omega) \, .
\end{equation}

Note we implicitly assumed that $\Omega \gg 1/T$ when we said that the four frequency regions could be considered separately.
Our analysis fails at frequencies lower than $1/T$.
This is a recurring theme in signal analysis: the acquisition time sets the frequency resolution.
We'll see more about this later one when we study spectral leakage.
