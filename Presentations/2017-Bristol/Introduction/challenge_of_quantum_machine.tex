Qubits must...
\begin{itemize}
  \item behave quantum-mechanically, i.e. no interaction with spurious degrees of freedom. Characteristic coherence times are called $T_1$, $T_2$, etc.
  \item be controllable faster than coherence times.
  \item interact with each other faster than coherence times.
  \item read out faster than coherence times.
\end{itemize}

Candidates:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Trapped ions
  \item Electron spins in silicon
  \item Superconducting circuits
\end{itemize}
