\levelstay{Introduction}

MKID arrays and superconducting qubits are measured by detecting phase and amplitude shifts imparted onto a microwave signal as it scatters from a resonant circuit interrupting a transmission line.
This report analyzes the relations between resonator energy, system output power, and signal to noise ratio.
