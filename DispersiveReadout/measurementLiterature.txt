Chow et al., arXiv:1311.6330
 2 us readout with paramp, single qubit
 One qubit done dispersively with paramp, others with HEMT only
 90% and 91% measurement fidelity at 2us

Saira et al., arXiv:1311.5530
 Single channel measurement
 89% at 450ns pulse duration
 Parameters in supplement, purcell limit ~100us, I think
 400 steady state photons
 Square envelope measurement pulse? (see supplement)
