# theory

Welcome to my repository of math and physics theory.
If something won't build, doesn't make sense, or if you would like to ask any questions at all about this repository, simply file an issue :D

## How to download

`$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/DanielSank/theory.git`

The `--recursive` flag ensures that git pulls down the necessary submodules (I use a submodule for my TeX packages and macros).
More information about submodules is available here: [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## TeX style guide

1. Label elements as `type:location:description`.
