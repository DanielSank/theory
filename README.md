# theory

Welcome to my repository of math and physics theory.
If something won't build, doesn't make sense, or if you would like to ask any questions at all about this repository, simply file an issue :D

## How to download

`$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/DanielSank/theory.git`

The `--recursive` flag ensures that git pulls down the necessary submodules (I use a submodule for my TeX packages and macros).
More information about submodules is available here: [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## Contributing

* Directories names are `lower-case-with-dashes`.
Acryonyms are still capitalized, e.g. `SNR-calculations`.

* File names are `lower_case_with_underscores`. Acronyms are fine in file names, e.g. `SNR_calculation.tex`.
