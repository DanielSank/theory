# theory

Welcome to my repository of math and physics theory.
If something won't build, doesn't make sense, or if you would like to ask any questions at all about this repository, simply file an issue :D

## How to download

`$ git clone https://github.com/DanielSank/theory`

Note that this repository uses a git [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
If you clone this repository with a vanilla git setup, you'll have a `TeX` subdirectory with nothing in it.
You can either configure git to automatically pull the submodule contents, or you can do it manually as described in the link.
