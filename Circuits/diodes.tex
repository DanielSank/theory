The IV equation for a diode is
\begin{equation}
I_{d}=I_{0}(e^{V_{d}/V_{0}}-1)
\end{equation}
The input diode on the Vishay IL66/ILD66/ILQ66 photocouplers have values $I_{0}=5.1$ nA and $V_{0}=0.076$ V, giving a current of 10 mA for 1.1 V forward voltage drop.

From the diode IV we can compute the diode's current dependent resistance,
\begin{align}
dI_{d}/dV_{d} &= \frac{I_{0}}{V_{0}}e^{V_{d}/V_{0}}=\frac{1}{V_{0}}(I_{d}+I_{0}) \\
R(I_{d}) &= dV_{d}/dI_{d} \\
&= \frac{V_{0}}{I_{d}+I_{0}} \, .
\end{align}
Consider a diode in series with a resistor.
A source voltage $V$ is applied to this series circuit.
The currents through the resistor and diode are
\begin{equation}
I_{d} = I_{0}(e^{V_d / V_0} - 1) \qquad I_R = (V - V_d) / R \, .
\end{equation}
Since the circuit is series, these currents must be the same, so
\begin{equation}
\frac{V - V_d}{R} = I_0 (e^{V_d / V_0} - 1)
\end{equation}
The interesting questions is, what are the diode current and voltage as a function of source voltage for a given resistor?
Pick a value of $V$.
Then, as a function of $V_{d}$ the left side of the equation defines a line with negative slope and y intercept of $V/R$.
The right side defines an exponential curve with y-intercept of zero.
These curves obviously cross for some value of $V_{d}$, and we can see that due to the exponential curve's large slope, the value of $V_{d}$ for which the curves cross is insensitive to $V$ once $V$ is above a certain value.
This is why diodes can be though of having a fixed forward voltage drop once they are ``on''.
Let's look at $dV_d / dV$,
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{dV_d}{dV} \right) &= \frac{I_0}{V_0} e^{V_d / V_{0}} \frac{dV_d}{dV} \\
\frac{d V_d}{dV} &= \frac{1}{1 + (I_d + I_0) R / V_0} \, .
\end{align}
