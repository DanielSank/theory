\maketitle

In this note, we relate the voltage on a mismatched load to the available power of an attenuated voltage source.
\textbf{All voltages in this document are RMS}.
We also relate the voltage and current across a load to the voltage measured by a matched probe, i.e. a $50\,\Omega$ scope probing a voltage source with a $50\,\Omega$ output impedance.

\section{Lumped source with matched load}

Consider, as shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:lumped_matched_load}, a voltage source $V_s$ with output impedance $Z_0$ connected to a matched resistor $R_l=Z_0$.
The voltage measured across the load is $V_l = V_s/2$.
The power delivered to this matched load, called the ``available power'' $P_a$, is
\begin{equation}
P_a = V_l^2 / Z_0 = (V_s/2)^2 / Z_0 \, .
\end{equation}
The term ``available power'' indicates that this is the largest amount of power which can be extracted from the source.\footnote{It is a simple exercise to prove that a voltage source delivers the maximum power when connected to a matched load.}
Note that $P_a$ is the power you would measure at room temperature with a spectrum analyzer.

Similarly, $V_l$ here is the voltage you would measure with a matched voltage probe (oscilloscope).
Therefore, we denote $V_l$ for the matched load case by the symbol $V_{\text{meas}}$.
Of course, $P_a = V_{\text{meas}}^2 / Z_0$.

\section{Transmission line source with matched load}

Now suppose we connect our source to a transmission line with characteristic impedance $Z_0$, as shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:tline_matched_load}.
The output impedance of the source plus line is still $Z_0$, and the open circuit voltage is istill $V_s$.
Therefore, the voltage source, its output resistor, and the transmission line are Thevenin equivalent to just the source and its output resistor.
Therefore, if we connect a load $R_l=Z_0$, we again have the voltage at the load as $V_l = V_s/2$.
The power dissipated into the load is therefore again $P_a$.
Because the reflection coefficient $\Gamma$ is zero,
\begin{equation}
\Gamma = \frac{R_l - Z_0}{R_l + Z_0} = 0 \, ,
\end{equation}
the load power must equal the input power flow $P_{\text{in}}$ carried by the input travelling voltage wave with amplitude $V_{\text{in}}$.
In other words,
\begin{align}
P_a &= P_\text{in} \nonumber \\
\frac{(V_s/2)^2}{Z_0} &= \frac{V_{\text{in}}^2}{Z_0} \nonumber \\
\text{so} \qquad V_{\text{in}} &= V_s/2 \, .
\end{align}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Attenuator}

Suppose we add an attenuator which attenuates power by a factor of $A$ to the transmission line.
The output impedance of the voltage source, resistor, transmission line, and attenuator is still $Z_0$.
The only difference is that, with a matched load, the rightward travelling wave amplitude is now $V_\text{in} = V_s/2\sqrt{A}$.
Therefore, the system is equivalent to the one without the attenuator as long as we scale the source voltage to $V_s'=V_s / \sqrt{A}$.

\section{Arbitrary load}

Now suppose we terminate the line with an arbitrary load $Z_l$.
The voltage at the load is
\begin{align}
V_l
&= V_{\text{in}} + V_{\text{out}} \\
&= V_{\text{in}} (1 + \Gamma) \\
&= V_{\text{in}} \frac{2 Z_l}{Z_l + Z_0} \\
&= \frac{V_s'}{2} \frac{2 Z_l}{Z_l + Z_0} \\
&= \frac{V_s}{\sqrt{A}} \frac{Z_l}{Z_l + Z_0} \\
&= 2 \frac{V_{\text{meas}}}{\sqrt{A}} \frac{Z_l}{Z_l + Z_0} \\
&= 2 \sqrt{\frac{P_a Z_0}{A}} \frac{Z_l}{Z_l + Z_0} \, . \label{eq:V_l}
\end{align}

\section{Thinking in terms of available power}

There's an easy way to remember all of this by thinking only in terms of available power.
The load voltage is related to the input wave voltage by
\begin{equation}
V_l = V_{\text{in}}(1 + \Gamma) = V_{\text{in}} \frac{2 Z_l}{Z_l + Z_0} \,
\end{equation}
The input wave voltage is related to the \emph{power available at the load}, denoted $P_{a,l}$ by
\begin{equation}
P_{a,l} = V_{\text{in}}^2 / Z_0 \, .
\end{equation}
Finally, the power available at the load is related to the source power by $P_{a,l} = P_a / A$.
Combining these results gives
\begin{equation}
V_l = 2 \sqrt{\frac{P_a Z_0}{A}} \frac{Z_l}{Z_l + Z_0} = \frac{2 V_\text{meas}}{\sqrt{A}} \frac{Z_l}{Z_l + Z_0}
\end{equation}
which agrees with Eq.\,(\ref{eq:V_l}).

\section{Load current}

The load current is
\begin{align}
I_l
&= V_l / Z_l \nonumber \\
&= \frac{2 V_\text{meas}}{\sqrt{A}} \frac{1}{Z_l + Z_0} \, .
\end{align}
In the special case that the load is a short we get
\begin{equation}
I_\text{short} = \frac{2 V_\text{meas}}{\sqrt{A}} \frac{1}{Z_0} \, .
\end{equation}
