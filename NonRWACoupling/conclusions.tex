\levelstay{Conclusions}

We have shown that the rotating wave approximation can be made exact for both driven and coupled electromagnetic resonators.
In each case, the rotating wave approximation is exact when the strengths of the couplings, associated to the two conjugate degrees of freedom (flux and charge), are equal.
This observation suggests that certain non-ideal behaviors associated with the rotating wave approximation might be suppressed by proper engineering.
For example, further research could investigate whether the deleterious processes identified in Ref.~\cite{Sank:rotating_wave:2016} may be eliminated by engineering a device where the qubit-resonator coupling has both capacitive and inductive components with equal and opposite strength.
