\abstract{
The rotating wave approximation (RWA) is ubiquitous in analysis of driven and coupled resonant systems.
However, the limitations of the RWA seem to be poorly understood and in some cases the RWA may dispose of essential physics.
We investigate the RWA in the context of electrical resonant circuits.
Using a classical Hamiltonian approach, we find that by balancing electrical and magnetic aspects of the drive or coupling, the RWA can be made to be exact.
