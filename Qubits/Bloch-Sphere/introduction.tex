\levelstay{Introduction}

Superconducting resonant circuits have become important elements for quantum computation.
When the circuits are cooled to temperatures such that the thermal energy is significantly smaller (approximately $5\times$) than the quantum energy, i.e. $T \ll \hbar \omega / k_b$, their energy levels become quantized and they can be used as quantum bits, known as ``qubits''.
Commercial dilution refrigerators can cool to about $10\,\text{mK}$.
Noting that $(2\pi) \hbar / k_b = 48\,\text{mK} / \text{GHz}$, we can see that we need a qubit resonance frequency of
\begin{equation}
  \omega / 2 \pi > 5 \times \frac{k_b}{2\pi \hbar} \, 10\,\text{mK} \approx 1 \, \text{GHz}
\end{equation}
so superconducting qubits are necessarily microwave devices.
Therefore, the logic state of the qubit is manipulated by microwave pulses applied to the circuit.
This technical note explains how the qubit state depends on the applied microwaves.

However, we're going to do this a bit differently.
The entire discussion will be classical.
