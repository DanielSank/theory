\section{Introduction - statement of purpose}

Designing and using superconducting qubits is a joyful experience.
Superconducting qubits bring together physics and engineering in a way that delights the mind by offering a single focal point through which one can learn and apply quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical physics, circuit theory, and various aspects of practical engineering.

One of the most important aspects of designing a superconducting qubit is understanding how control pulses are brought to the device and how the devices couple to each other.
Designing the qubit control and coupling requires an understanding of the relations between physical parameters, such as capacitance and inductance, and ``model'' parameters like operators and coefficients in the qubits' Hamiltonians.
For example, one must know how to relate the coupling strength between two qubits to those qubits' capacitance, inductance, etc., and the capacitance/inductance of the coupling element.

Uri Vool has written an excellent paper on the quantization of arbitrary lumped-element electrical circuits, including a discussion of dissipative elements \cite{Vool:quantumCircuits}, and that work must be considered prerequisite reading for this one.\footnote{Vool's paper is a spiritual rewrite of an earlier \mbox{\href{http://qulab.eng.yale.edu/documents/reprints/Houches_fluctuations.pdf}{set of course notes}} for the Les Houches school, written Michel Devoret. Among other things, the rewrite corrects several unfortunate typos from the original.}
In other words, Reference \cite{Vool:quantumCircuits} tells you how to write the Hamiltonian for a given circuit.
The next step is to apply the Hamiltonian technique to the most common qubit circuits, examine how controls and coupling work, and arrive at useful design formulae.
One an imagine a sort of ``superconductinq qubit builder's guide'' which provides a list of useful and important design formulae, as well as enough of a demonstration of where those formulae come from such that the designer can break new ground on their own, knowing well what practical considerations must be taken into account.
This document intends to be such a guide.

This document is not, nor can it even be, comprehensive.
However, it does offer a route to ensure that important missing elements are added as time goes on and that the quality is always increasing: this document's source code lives in a \href{https://github.com/danielsank/theory}{publicly accessible repository} on GitHub.
Typos, identification of unclear sections, and requests for additional information should reported on the \href{https://github.com/danielsank/theory/issues}{issue tracker} will lead to improvements in the document.
In this way, readers become authors, shared knowledge grows, and we all learn what need to know faster than we could before.
