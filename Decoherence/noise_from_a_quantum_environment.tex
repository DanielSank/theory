\levelstay{Decay/excitation rates from resonant noise}

Consider a quantum system $S$ connected to a large environment $E$ with the following hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H = H_S + H_E + V
\end{equation}
where $H_S$ is the Hamiltonian of the system, $H_E$ is the Hamiltonian of the environment, and $V$ is an interaction.
For this discussion we assume the system is a two level system with Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H_S / \hbar = - \frac{\Omega}{2} \sigma_z
\end{equation}
and we assume the interaction has the form
\begin{equation}
V / \hbar = g \left( F \otimes \sigma_x \right)
\end{equation}
where $F$ acts on $E$ and $\sigma_x$ acts on $S$.

We work in the rotating frame generated by the following time translation operator $T(t)$ given as
\begin{equation}
T(t) = T_S(t) \otimes T_E(t)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
T_E(t) = \exp \left[ - \frac{i}{\hbar} H_E t \right]
\qquad
T_S(t)
= \exp \left[ - \frac{i}{\hbar} H_S t \right]
= \exp \left[ \frac{i}{2} \Omega t \sigma_z \right] \, .
\end{equation}
In this frame $H_E$ and $H_S$ vanish, but $V$ becomes
\begin{equation}
\tilde{V}(t)
\equiv T^\dagger(t) V T(t)
= \hbar g \tilde{V}_E(t) \otimes \tilde{V}_S(t)
= \hbar g
F(t)
\otimes \left( e^{i \Omega t}\sigma_+ + e^{-i \Omega t} \sigma_- \right) \, .
\end{equation}

We're going to see what happens when our two level system interacts with the environment.
In particular, we will see how transitions between the two states are induced by fluctuations in the bath.
We do this via perturbation theory in almost exactly the way Fermi's golden rule is normally derived in textbooks.
